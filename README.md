# Black Tech Bravado - BTB

> Unfortunately, the Tech Industy has begun to mirror some of the most racially pervasive and biased spaces in America. Consequently , Black men and Black women find themselves in a too familiar reality where they're capable of doing a job but remain  grossly underrepresented in the industry. Black Tech Bravado--a Tech Blogging App-- intends to help solve this problem by increasing the representation and participation of black women and men in the technology industry by providing a space where their voices can be heard and skills show cased.
